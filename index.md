# CIT 281 Code Portfolio:
<br>

Throughout the course, I was exposed to many software tools and technologies including: Git, Unix, Node.js, JSON and AJAX, covering the fundamentals of web application development. Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience of these tools and technologies, and developed computational thinking skills by completing a series of CIT projects.

The following projects exemplify my gained knowledge of Unix shell commands, the navigation of Git workflow to manage repos, as well as API basics and much more.
